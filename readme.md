# Finance App

- Develop an app to control personal finances.

- The app can be used by anyone and its database will be local.

- Releases may be one-off, installments or recurring.

- Unique releases only appear in the month of purchase.

- Installment releases will be added automatically every month until the last installment.

- Recurring releases will be released every month until the user cancels the release.

- The user can create an entry to record their final balance with all the expenses for the month, that is, the user can enter the value of their salary to know if the value is compatible with their expenses.

- The app will have a screen for the user to simulate savings, creating the number of months and the amount to be saved and the app will show how much they will have at the end of the period.

- To register, the app will only ask for a username, and as many users as necessary can be created.
